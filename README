== ASAP - a Parallel Fetch Library =====================================

by Greg Spurrier, Avik Das

== DESCRIPTION =========================================================

ASAP is a JRuby library built on top of Netty and Java's NIO classes. It
provides an embedded domain specific language for specifying a list of
resources to fetch, all in parallel, as well specify a dependency tree
in order to use previous results in calculating subsequent ones. The
results of all the requests are then automatically collected into a
simple tree-like data structure that has a one-to-one mapping to the
tree structure specified by the code, despite the fact that results may
arrive in an unspecified order.

== EXAMPLE =============================================================

Assume that a server is running on http://0.0.0.0:1234, which maps the
paths /user/followers and /user/followers/N to a list of five numbers and
data related to the Nth follower respectively.

  require 'asap'

  data = Asap do
    get 'http://0.0.0.0:1234/user/followers' do |followers|
      followers = followers.split("\n").map(&:to_i)

      # get the first 3 followers
      get "http://0.0.0.0:1234/user/followers/#{followers[0]}"
      get "http://0.0.0.0:1234/user/followers/#{followers[1]}"
      get "http://0.0.0.0:1234/user/followers/#{followers[2]}"

      # or you can use a map
      followers[3,2].each do |fi|
        get "http://0.0.0.0:1234/user/followers/#{fi}"
      end
    end
  end

  p data

  # => [["93\n5\n64\n74\n11",
          ["Follower #93",
           "Follower #5" ,
           "Follower #64",
           "Follower #74",
           "Follower #11"]]]

== QUICK START =========================================================
  
  gem install asap

== DEVELOPMENT QUICK START =============================================

  # Check out repository
  git clone git://github.com/avik-das/asap.git
  cd asap

  # Make sure you're using JRuby

  # Install the dependencies
  gem install bundler
  bundle install
  rake install

  # start the server (run in a separate window)
  asap-mongrel-test-server

  # run the tests
  rake spec

  # compare the times required to fetch the same data if it is retrieved
  # serially versus if it is retrieved with ASAP.
  time examples/followers-example-serial.rb
  time examples/followers-example.rb
  
  # There is an alternate, EventMachine-based server, but it does not
  # implement the /user/followers/ routes. EventMachine does not run
  # well with JRuby, while the main library requires JRuby. However,
  # the EventMachine-based server runs well on MRI, assuming the
  # correct gems are installed (see the gemspec).
